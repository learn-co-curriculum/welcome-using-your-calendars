# Utilizing Your Calendars

You will be using two calendars found within Canvas during your time in the
program.

The first of these calendars can be found in your Global Navigation Bar on the
left hand side. This calendar will specifically display assignment due dates
across all of your courses.

The second calendar you'll need to utilize is located on the Home page of this
Homeroom course. This second calendar will display lectures and Zoom links for
said lectures, as well as additional community and course-specific events.

Please be sure to check both calendars regularly.
